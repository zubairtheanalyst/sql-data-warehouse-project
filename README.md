# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project  

Welcome to my portfolio project! 🚀  
This repository contains my implementation of a **complete SQL-based Data Warehouse and Analytics solution**, following modern best practices in **Data Engineering** and **Analytics**.  

The project takes raw **ERP & CRM business data**, builds a **data warehouse using Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)**, and delivers **actionable insights** through SQL-based reporting and analysis.

## 💡 Why I Did This Project  

I built this project as part of my **portfolio** to demonstrate end-to-end skills in **Data Engineering, Data Modeling, and Analytics**.  

Working through the full data lifecycle – from raw CSV ingestion to business-ready analytics – helped me strengthen my understanding of:  

✔️ Structuring a **modern Data Warehouse**  
✔️ Designing **ETL pipelines** for data transformation  
✔️ Creating **star schema models** for analytics  
✔️ Writing **SQL-based insights** that answer key business questions  

This project was both a **practical challenge** and an opportunity to showcase the way I approach **real-world data problems**.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture  

The solution is structured using the **Medallion Architecture** pattern:  

- 🥉 **Bronze Layer** → Stores raw data (CSV files) ingested into SQL Server  
- 🥈 **Silver Layer** → Cleansed, standardized, and normalized data ready for integration  
- 🥇 **Gold Layer** → Business-ready data modeled into a **Star Schema** for analytics and reporting
