## General Principles

- **Naming Conventions:** Use `snake_case` with lowercase letters and underscores (`_`) to separate words.  
- **Language:** Use English for all names.  
- **Avoid Reserved Words:** Do not use SQL reserved words as object names.

## Table Naming Conventions

### Bronze Rules

- All names must start with the **source system name**, and table names must match their original names without renaming.  
- Format: `<sourcesystem>_<entity>`  
  - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm`, `erp`)  
  - `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system  

**Example:**  
`crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### Silver Rules

- Same rules as Bronze: `<sourcesystem>_<entity>`  
- Tables reflect the cleaned and standardized data from source systems.

**Example:**  
`crm_customer_info` → Cleaned/standardized customer info from CRM.

### Gold Rules

- Use **meaningful, business-aligned names** starting with a **category prefix**:  
- Format: `<category>_<entity>`  
  - `<category>`: Role of the table (e.g., `dim` for dimension, `fact` for fact table)  
  - `<entity>`: Descriptive business-aligned name  

**Examples:**  
- `dim_customers` → Dimension table for customer data  
- `fact_sales` → Fact table containing sales transactions  

**Glossary of Category Patterns**

| Pattern | Meaning         | Example(s)                |
|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| dim_    | Dimension table | dim_customer, dim_product |
| fact_   | Fact table      | fact_sales                |
| report_ | Report table    | report_customers, report_sales_monthly |

## Column Naming Conventions

### Surrogate Keys

- All primary keys in **dimension tables** must use the suffix `_key`.  
- Format: `<table_name>_key`  
- **Example:** `customer_key` → Surrogate key in the `dim_customers` table

### Technical Columns

- All technical columns must start with the prefix `dwh_`, followed by a descriptive name indicating the column's purpose.  
- Format: `dwh_<column_name>`  
- **Example:** `dwh_load_date` → Stores the date when the record was loaded

---

## Stored Procedures

- All stored procedures used for loading data must follow the pattern: `load_<layer>`  
- `<layer>`: Represents the layer being loaded (`bronze`, `silver`, `gold`)  

**Examples:**  
- `load_bronze` → Loads data into Bronze layer  
- `load_silver` → Loads data into Silver layer
